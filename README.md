## Types and Programming Languages ##

This repository contains some code that I've written while going through Benjamin C. Pierce's "Types and Programming Languages". The book itself contains OCaml implementations of various concepts, but the code in this repository is very much so not a translation of those implementations - I generally wrote these while reading the chapters.

None of the examples so far have parsers/lexers - their inputs are generally an abstract syntax representation.
